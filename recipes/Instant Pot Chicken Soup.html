    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A simple recipe for Instant Pot chicken soup with chicken thighs and breasts. I do not add noodles to mine, however, if you wanted to add noodles, I would release pressure after about 10 minutes instead of naturally, add the noodles, and set on manual for 3 to 5 minutes. I use all organic produce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>5 stalks celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 small heads garlic, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken bone broth</li>
        <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package baby carrots</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth base (such as Superior Touch™ Better Than Bouillon™)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
      

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Sauté function. Add oil, celery, onion, and garlic. Cook until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix bone broth, chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, carrots, herbes de Provence, broth base, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and bay leaves into the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select low pressure. Set timer for 25 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, allow 10 to 40 minutes. Remove bay leaves before serving.</li>
    </ol>
